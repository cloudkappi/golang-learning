	Leaves of every hue ~ Sadhguru

colourful feast for eye
But a death dance
Of colour. Not of gaiety
but of cold gravity
Crown and clothing
all tumbling down
Being stripped off
of life making sap
Trees will stand naked
of leaf, flower or fruit
Only in hope of
another lease of life
Autumnal fall
Winter’s rot
Spring’s surprise
This not of life or death
but of life and death
Not a catastrophe
But a carnival
No where to go
As all is Here.
